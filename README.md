Limitations
Requires an active internet connection for most features

Speech recognition accuracy may vary based on microphone quality and environment noise

Currently uses a wake word ("Luffy") for activation

Future Improvements
Add more commands and functionalities

Improve error handling and speech recognition

Implement offline capabilities for basic commands

Add customization options for the wake word and voice

Note
This is a personal project for educational purposes. The NewsAPI key in the code is just a placeholder - you should get your own API key from NewsAPI.org for production use.
